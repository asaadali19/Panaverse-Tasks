//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print t
//he name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

let person_name = " \tAsad\n";
console.log(person_name);

console.log(person_name.trim());
